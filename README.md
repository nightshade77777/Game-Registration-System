Task 2:

This calculation should take into account the skill level of the player.

The system should display the fee in the appropriate currency, using these exchange rates:
• £ sterling for all UK players; no exchange rate required
• £1 = 1.50 US dollars
• £1 = 2.00 AU dollars.

The entry fee will consist of:

• £10 per player

• an additional fee of £35 for ‘Expert’ players or £20 for ‘Casual’ players.

Fee calculator requirements

• The fee calculator should start with a welcome message.

• It should ask the user for the player’s:
• email address

• skill level (E for expert, C for casual)

• country (UK, US, AU).
• It should then calculate the entry fee.

• The fee should be displayed in the correct currency, using the following
abbreviations: USD, AUD, GBP.

• It should then ask if the user wishes to calculate another fee.
